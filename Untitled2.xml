    <setting>On Board La Touraine,</setting>
    <date type="m/d/y"><month>June 30th,</month>
        <year>1917</year></date>. <p num="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems
        impossible that I am actually off to <loco type="country">France</loco> and, for the
        first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the
            <org>American Fund for French Wounded</org> found an opening for me in
                <loco type="city">Paris</loco> that I suppose I am still somewhat dazed and
        bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead
        makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste
        in <loco><city>New York</city></loco> of the work that the <org type="acro">A. F. F.
            W.</org> is doing but its Headquarters in <loco type="city">Paris</loco> will be
        different in some ways I fancy.</p>
    <p num="2">I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how <desc>few girls
            of my age</desc> are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you
        encourage me on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of
        late.</p>
    <p num="3">As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
        alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds.
        How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one
        spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after another
        appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in <loco type="city?">Lakewood</loco>
        and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment.
        Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</p>
    <p num="4">We waited <loco type="landmark">near the Statue of Liberty</loco> until <time>midnight</time>—a rumor
        had it that a "personage" was to come on board. This individual was <desc>shrouded in
            mystery</desc> until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had
        clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose at
        once for, what with <person>Frank Sayre</person> on the boat and these distinguished Italian
        gentlemen, we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However,
        thus far we have but two destroyers following us. They can be seen distinctly outlined
        against the horizon, one on each side, and seem to be the same somber gray which all ships
        are affecting in this war. A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger
        for the first four or five days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's
        hoping! <!--why is she excited to be in danger?--></p>
    <p num="5">I have a small inside cabin and <person>my room-mate</person> is quite a character.
        She is a native of <loco type="country">Haiti</loco>, <desc>voluble and very
            portly</desc>—<desc>has four large pieces of baggage</desc> in our tiny stateroom,
            <desc>wears a costume</desc> which resembles a Mother Hubbard and <desc>smokes countless
            thin cigarettes</desc> that smell like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be
        much room for me but, as she says, luckily <desc>I am small</desc>, and I was soon tucked
        into the upper berth with my belongings! <desc>She really isn't bad</desc> and after looking
        me over carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed
        upon me! She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the French since the
        beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, <desc>having lost some fingers
            off each hand.</desc> She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his
        fingers.</p> [<label>Source:</label>
